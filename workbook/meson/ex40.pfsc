    # GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    #   The initial Meson script names nodes, but does not link them together.
    #   DELETE this script, and REPLACE it with the script the exercise asks
    #   you to write.
    #
    #   After writing the script, use Ctrl-B to build (or right-click the
    #   background of the editor and select "Build").
    #
    # EXERCISE:
    #
    # Try combining inference and support:
    #
    #   A so B by C.
    #
